## Summary
This document analyzes the results of testing the Recipe Chatbot with our enhanced system prompt and realistic queries. The bulk test script was executed with a valid OpenAI API key, allowing us to evaluate the chatbot's actual responses to 18 diverse recipe queries.

## Test Setup
- **Date**: May 26, 2025
- **Model**: openai/gpt-4.1-mini
- **Number of Queries**: 18
- **Query Types**: Various realistic, informal recipe requests including dietary restrictions, specific ingredients, time constraints, and skill levels
- **System Prompt**: Comprehensive Spanish-language culinary assistant with detailed formatting and content guidelines

## Key Findings

## Identified Issues and Failure Modes

### Issue 1: Ambiguous Ingredient Preparation Recognition
**Problem**: When users input ingredients that require preparation (e.g., "masa de pizza de un dia para otro" - pizza dough from one day to another), the chatbot sometimes interprets this as a recipe request rather than recognizing it as a prepared ingredient.

**Example**: The query "masa de pizza de un dia para otro" was interpreted as a request for how to make overnight pizza dough, rather than what to do with already-prepared overnight pizza dough.

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Closing Messages
**Problem**: The response endings vary inconsistently, sometimes saying "Espero que disfrutes" (hope you enjoy) and other times including "¿Quieres que te sugiera otra receta?" (would you like me to suggest another recipe?).

**Examples**: 
- "Espero que disfrutes de tu mousse vegano sin nueces!"
- "Espero que disfrutes de tu Pollo al Horno con Hierbas y Limón! ¿Quieres que te sugiera otra receta con pollo?"

### Issue 3: Missing Measurement Details
**Problem**: Not all ingredients consistently include measurements or approximations, despite the system prompt requiring this.

**Example**: Some responses include "cebolla pequeña" without the specified format of "1 cebolla pequeña (aproximadamente 100 gramos)".

### Issue 4: Incomplete Technique Explanations
**Problem**: Some cooking techniques like "juliana" are not always explained, though the system prompt requires brief explanations for specific processes.

**Example**: References to cutting techniques without the required format like "en juliana (cortes de 5mm)".

## Example Responses Analysis

### Example 1: Dietary Restriction Handling
**Query**: "Vegan dessert recipe without nuts"
**Response Quality**: Excellent
- Correctly identified and addressed both dietary restrictions (vegan and nut-free)
- Provided clear ingredient substitutions using coconut cream
- Included proper measurements and detailed instructions
- Added helpful tips for ingredient quality and variations

### Example 2: Ingredient-Based Query
**Query**: "I have chicken and rice. what can I cook?"
**Response Quality**: Good
- Successfully created a cohesive recipe using the specified ingredients
- Added complementary ingredients with proper measurements
- Provided clear cooking instructions
- Included helpful tips for variations

### Example 3: Ambiguous Query Processing
**Query**: "masa de pizza de un dia para otro"
**Response Quality**: Problematic
- Misinterpreted the user's intent
- Provided a recipe for making overnight pizza dough instead of using prepared dough
- Demonstrates the identified issue with ingredient preparation recognition


## Conclusion
The testing demonstrates that our enhanced system prompt effectively guides the chatbot's behavior, producing well-structured, helpful responses in Spanish to realistic queries. The chatbot successfully handles diverse dietary restrictions, ingredient combinations, and time constraints while maintaining professional formatting standards.

However, several specific issues were identified that could improve user experience, particularly around ingredient preparation context recognition and consistency in response formatting. These findings provide clear targets for system prompt refinement and additional training data generation.

The results validate our approach of creating a comprehensive system prompt with clear guidelines, while highlighting the importance of continued testing with edge cases and ambiguous queries to identify potential failure modes.
