Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  \n2. Wash and peel the sweet potato. Use a sharp mandoline slicer or a sharp knife to cut into thin, even slices about 1/8 inch thick.  \n3. Place the sweet potato slices in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat evenly.  \n4. Arrange the slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they do not overlap.  \n5. Sprinkle salt, black pepper, and paprika (if using) evenly over the slices.  \n6. Bake for 12-15 minutes, flipping once at the halfway mark, until the edges are crisp and golden brown.  \n7. Remove from the oven and let cool for 2 minutes before serving.  \n\n### Notes  \n- Keep an eye on the chips after 12 minutes to prevent burning.  \n- For extra flavor, sprinkle with your favorite herbs after baking."}]}}
