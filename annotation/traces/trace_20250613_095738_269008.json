However, I have a delicious keto-friendly snack idea that can be prepared in about an hour: **Keto Cheese and Bacon Stuffed Mushrooms**. \n\n### Keto Cheese and Bacon Stuffed Mushrooms (Serves 2)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 8 large fresh mushrooms (white or cremini)\n- 4 oz (115g) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded\n- 4 oz (115g) cream cheese, softened\n- 4 slices of bacon\n- 1 garlic clove, minced\n- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (optional)\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prep the bacon:**  \n   - In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 6-8 minutes.  \n   - Remove from skillet, drain on paper towels, and once cooled, chop into small bits. Set aside.\n\n2. **Clean the mushrooms:**  \n   - Gently wipe the mushrooms with a damp paper towel to remove dirt.  \n   - Carefully remove the stems and set them aside for another use (like adding to the filling).  \n\n3. **Make the filling:**  \n   - In a bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, shredded cheddar, minced garlic, half of the chopped bacon, and chopped mushroom stems (if using).  \n   - Mix well until smooth. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n\n4. **Stuff the mushrooms:**  \n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).  \n   - Arrange the mushroom caps on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  \n   - Using a small spoon, fill each mushroom cap generously with the cheese mixture.\n\n5. **Bake:**  \n   - Drizzle the tops with a little olive oil to promote browning.  \n   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is bubbly and golden on top.\n\n6. **Garnish and serve:**  \n   - Remove from oven, sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired, and serve hot.\n\n### Serving size: 2 servings (4 stuffed mushrooms per person)\n\nThis savory snack is rich, satisfying, and perfect for a keto lunch with just a little prep time. Enjoy!"}]}}
