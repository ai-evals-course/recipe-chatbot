Slice each chicken breast into 1/2-inch strips.\n\n2. **Cook the chicken:**  \n   Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  \n   Add chicken strips, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.  \n   Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and browned.\n\n3. **Cook the eggs:**  \n   While chicken cooks, crack 2 eggs into a bowl, beat with a fork.  \n   In a separate small non-stick skillet, heat over medium. Pour in eggs.  \n   Scramble gently for 2-3 minutes until just set.\n\n4. **Assemble the wraps:**  \n   Lay lettuce leaves flat on plates.  \n   Divide scrambled eggs and cooked chicken evenly between the two leaves.  \n   Sprinkle shredded cheese on top of chicken.  \n   Roll or fold lettuce leaves around fillings to form wraps.\n\n5. **Serve immediately.**\n\n### Notes\n- Using large lettuce leaves as wraps keeps the dish low-carb.\n- For extra flavor, add sliced avocado or hot sauce if desired."}]}}
