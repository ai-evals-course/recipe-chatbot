Pour the vegetable broth into a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Keep warm throughout the cooking process.\n2. In a separate large skillet or saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until translucent.\n3. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are browned and their moisture has evaporated.\n4. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n5. Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes to toast the rice.\n6. If using white wine, pour it in now and cook, stirring, until mostly absorbed, about 2-3 minutes.\n7. Begin adding the warm vegetable broth, one ladleful (about 1/2 cup) at a time, stirring constantly. Wait until the liquid is mostly absorbed before adding the next ladleful. Continue this process, stirring continuously, for about 25-30 minutes, until the rice is creamy and tender but still has a slight bite.\n8. Turn off the heat. Stir in the butter, grated Parmesan, thyme, and chopped parsley. Mix until well combined.\n9. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n10. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld.\n\n### Notes\n- Maintaining a gentle simmer of the broth ensures even cooking and prevents the risotto from becoming too thick or sticky.\n- Stir constantly during the broth addition to achieve the creamy texture characteristic of good risotto."}]}}
