Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook for 10 minutes, or until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain, reserving \u00bd cup of pasta water.\n\n2. While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. When melted, add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.\n\n3. Add the drained pasta to the skillet. Toss to coat evenly in the garlic butter mixture.\n\n4. Pour in the reserved pasta water gradually, 2 tablespoons at a time, to loosen the sauce and help it cling to the noodles. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\n\n5. Remove from heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, grated Parmesan, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using. Mix until cheese melts and resulting sauce is creamy.\n\n6. Transfer to serving plates. Sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately.\n\n### Notes\n- Always cook pasta al dente; it maintains texture and prevents mushiness."}]}}
