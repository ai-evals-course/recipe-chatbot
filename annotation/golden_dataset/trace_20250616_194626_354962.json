Mix thoroughly.\n\n2. **Roll out the dough:**\n   - Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper.\n   - Roll out with a rolling pin until about 1/8 inch thick.\n\n3. **Cut into pasta shapes:**\n   - Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into 1/4-inch wide strips to mimic spaghetti.\n   - Carefully peel away the top parchment.\n\n4. **Cook the pasta:**\n   - Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.\n   - Add 1 tablespoon salt.\n   - Gently drop the cut dough into boiling water.\n   - Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring gently to prevent sticking.\n   - Once the pasta floats to the top, it is done.\n   - Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pasta to a colander and drain.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Heat your preferred low-carb pasta sauce in a separate pan for 2-3 minutes.\n   - Toss the cooked keto pasta into the sauce.\n   - Divide onto plates.\n   - Top with grated Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil if desired.\n\n### Notes\n- Make sure not to overcook the almond flour pasta, as it can become mushy.\n- Use fresh or refrigerated sauce to keep within the 1-hour timeframe.\n\nEnjoy your keto pasta family dinner!"}]}}
