Cut the pressed tofu into 1-inch cubes. Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute.\n3. Add tofu cubes to the skillet in a single layer. Cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes until golden brown on one side.\n4. Flip the tofu cubes carefully with tongs or a spatula, then cook another 3-4 minutes until golden on all sides.\n5. During the last minute of cooking, add minced garlic to the skillet and stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.\n6. Remove skillet from heat. Drizzle the tofu with soy sauce and sesame oil (if using). Toss gently to coat evenly.\n7. Transfer to a serving plate, garnish with chopped green onions, and serve immediately.\n\n### Notes\n- To make it even crispier, you can bake the tofu at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 10 minutes after pan-frying, but this is optional."}]}, "open_coding": "No serving size\r\n\r\nMaybe too much for 15 minutes.
